    The main reason why this website could be made. Starting in mid 2021 he started archiving hundreds of LTG troll channels and later on archived every LowTierGod Stream, mainly in 2022. Since 2022 he's had several other projects including clipping LTG streams into a massive clip archive, reuploading every LowTierGod video to various sites, and the Peanut Butter Complex channels.

    Automated the archiving process and archives Immo342 vods, but also gives backup LTG vods to Stainbine if needed. Helped Stainbine with lots of stuff.

    Founder of the Symphony of Spooks discord server, and prolific VOD archiver who came on the scene in 2020. He's filled in the gap of LTG streams from September 2020 until Early 2022 when Stainbine entered the scene. Recorded this man like a damn paparazzi.

    A prolific LowTierGod Stream archiver who has stayed quiet in the LTG scene. He's filled in the gap of LTG streams from Mid-2019 until Mid-2020, but is still going. His youtube was recently terminated by Superhound, but his vods remain on odysee and bitchute.

    A mysterious archive.org poster who archived huge quantities of LowTierGod streams from Mid-2018 until Early 2020. Stainbine believes he might be Homura Akemi's first attempt at vod archiving, eventually moving to bitchute. Except bitchute has a 2gb upload while archive has none, so this might not make sense.
