The Peanut Butter Complex
===============
  This Site is the main hub for LowTierGod-related Archives. It includes a troll channel archive (over 4.5K videos), a massive vod archive (around 1.5K), and links to a large clip archive, Low Tier God reuploads, and my troll channel.

:doc:`channels/index`
----------------------
GodTierArchive is an archive.org account preserving every LowTierGod troll channel terminated after June 2021 (when I started archiving). OVER HALF of ALL LTG-related videos on youtube have been wiped in less than 2 years (OVER 4500 VIDEOS), so this archive exists to ensure troll channels are preserved. 

With recent incidents of an incel copyright troll removing thousands of videos in less than a month, it's more important than ever to have an updated archive. In any case, all these videos are preserved on both Stainbine and Immo342's hardrives.

:doc:`vods/index`
----------------------
The complete LowTierGod stream archive, consisting of every LTG vod I've been able to find on the internet or download myself, viewable spread across 3 odysee accounts.

The current grand total is 1461 vods, probably closer to 1200 from some being days being split into multiple files. There are large, but unavoidable gaps in 2016, early 2017, and early 2018. Now that LTG's youtube is gone, and twitch might be aswell, the older vods are lost to time.

:doc:`clips/index`
----------------------
A Very large Collection of LTG stream clips clipped from raw vods with VLC media player and ffmpeg. Very good source for making troll videos. They do have some dead air so some editing is required; I recommend a KHG Team Sony Vegas crack.
