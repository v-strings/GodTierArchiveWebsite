GodTierArchive
===============
  This Site is the main hub for LowTierGod-related Archives. It features:
   
   
  Every Terminated LTG Troll channel, some by LowTierGod but most from Superhound. Over 4500 LTG videos have been deleted, but archived.\n
  The Master-Spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GALskO5OexjzF2O_KipRHaxnfpIyD0jtFT1ndmlgqOY/edit?usp=sharing
   
   
  Every LTG vod I've been able to find on the internet or download myself, viewable spread across 3 odysee accounts. 
  The current grand total is 1461 vods, probably closer to 1200 from some being split into multiple files. There are large, but unavoidable gaps in 2016, early 2017, and early 2018.\n
