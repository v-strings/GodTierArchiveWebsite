GodTierArchive
===============
  This Site is the main hub for LowTierGod-related Archives. This is only necessary because LTG tries to hide content about him. It features:
   
   
  Every Terminated LTG Troll channel, some by LowTierGod but most from Superhound. Over 4500 LTG videos have been deleted, but archived.

  My stream archive, consisting of every LTG vod I've been able to find on the internet or download myself, viewable spread across 3 odysee accounts. 
  The current grand total is 1461 vods, probably closer to 1200 from some being days being split into multiple files. There are large, but unavoidable gaps in 2016, early 2017, and early 2018.

   A Very large Collection of LTG stream clips, made with VLC media player and ffmpeg that can be used for making troll videos.

   I recommend a KHG Team Sony Vegas crack for making troll compilations.
