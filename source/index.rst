The Peanut Butter Complex
==========================
This Site is the main hub for LowTierGod-related Archives. It includes links to my troll channel archive (over 4.5K videos), a massive vod archive (around 1.5K), and a large rage clip archive, Low Tier God reuploads, and my troll channel.
  
  My archive projects wouldn't have been possible without `youtube-dl / yt-dlp <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp>`_, a very simple command-line youtube downloader. It's a must-have if you're serious about archiving videos or streams. You can archive entire youtube channels with thumbnails and comments in 1 simple command.
 
   
:doc:`channels/index`
----------------------
GodTierArchive is an archive.org account preserving every LowTierGod troll channel terminated after June 2021 (when I started archiving). 

.. note::

   With recent incidents of an incel copyright troll removing thousands of videos in less than a month, it's more important than ever to have an updated archive. In any case, all these videos are preserved on both Stainbine and Immo342's hardrives.

:doc:`vods/index`
----------------------
The complete LowTierGod stream archive, consisting of every LTG vod I've been able to find on the internet or download myself, viewable spread across 3 odysee accounts. 

   
:doc:`clips/index`
----------------------
`A Very large Collection <https://archive.org/details/@delawn_sparwow>`_ of LTG stream clips clipped from raw vods with VLC media player and ffmpeg. Very good source for making troll videos. They do have some dead air at the beginning and end, so some editing is required; I recommend a KHG Team Sony Vegas crack or reputable adobe premier one (use a virtual machine with free antiviruses to test risky torrents, obviously).

---------------Immo342 / Dale TV---------------
Prolific restreamer of LowTierGod; watch his restreams instead of LTG's actual ones its much more fun. Also he made 5.5K in donations off him.
Immo also streams troll channels including terminated ones from my archive, 24/7: https://www.youtube.com/@immo342/streams
