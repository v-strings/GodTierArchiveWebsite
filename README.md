==========================
Welcome! This is the Official Archive LTG.

With recent incidents of an incel copyright troll removing thousands of videos in less than a month, it's more important than ever to have an updated archive. In any case, all these videos are preserved on both Stainbine and Immo342's hardrives.

How To Contribute
----------------------
Contributing is very easy due to sphinx easy syntax. To start contributing there a few tools you need. 

### Tools 
```
* Python 3.11.0+ 
* Github Desktop(preferred)/Git 
* Code Editor (preferred) 
* pip
```
### Getting Started 

1) Pull/Download the code base from Github Desktop or Git.
2) Once downloaded open your terminal and navigate to the "GodTierArchiveWebsite" folder that was just created. 
3) Then open a Terminal and go to the path were GodTierArchiveWebsite was downloaded.
4) Type in the command `python -m venv .venv` and a `.venv` folder should be created in the base folder. 
5) Type in `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat` to set up the virtual environments. Mac and Linux have a [different syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
6) If your terminal has the (.venv) to the left of the path you did everything correctly. If you don’t see this text ask for help in the discord below.

> (.venv) C:\GodTierArchiveWebsite>

7) This project uses a lot of external packages so type in `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them all and wait for that to finish.
8) In the terminal cd into the doc’s directory and type `make html`.
9) If the build succeeded you can start editing the documentation.
10) All code that you edit will be in the `docs/source/` folder. The `docs/build/` folder has the final build of documentation.
11) To see your changes, you can open `docs/build/html/("file_name").html` in your browser to see your changes.

> If you had problems setting up you can check out the offical [sphnix docs](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html>) or ask in the discord. 

### Contributing

1. Join the discord so you can discuss your ideas with others so we can synergize with other helpers.
2. Once you finished making changes you can submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
3. Once you submitted a pull request let us know in the discord so we can check it as fast as possible.
4. Once a team member determins that the request fits the structure of code base it will be merged into the repository.
